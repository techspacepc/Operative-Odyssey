  - PageTitle: Eye Structure
    PageInfo: 'Figure 2 shows the parts around an eye and outside it. The eyebrows
      make sure that sweat and other liquids do not get into your eyes. The eyelashes
      protect the eyes against dirt and bright light. The white of the eye is called
      the sclera. The eye muscles are attached to the sclera (see figure 3). The
      eye muscles can turn the eyes in any desired direction. The coloured part of
      the eye is called the iris. The iris has an opening called the pupil. The pupil
      lets light into the eye. The iris and the pupil are covered by the transparent
      cornea. '

  - PageTitle: Pupillary Reflex
    PageInfo: Light enters your eye through the pupil. The pupil gets larger and
      smaller depending on the amount of light. This is referred to as the pupillary
      reflex. The pupillary reflex regulates the amount of light that falls onto
      the retina. When there is a lot of light, the pupil gets smaller (see figure
      5.1). Less light can then enter your eye. When the light is dim, the pupil
      gets bigger (see figure 5.2). A large pupil lets a lot of light through. This
      lets you see even when it is almost dark.
