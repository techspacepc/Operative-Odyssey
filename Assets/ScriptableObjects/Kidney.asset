  - PageTitle: Adrenal Glands
    PageInfo: "The adrenal glands are like caps on top of the kidneys (see figure
      4). When you are furious or scared of something, the adrenal glands release
      the hormone adrenaline into the blood. Adrenaline makes the liver convert glycogen
      into glucose. As a result, the blood glucose level rises. Adrenaline also makes
      your heart beat more rapidly and makes you breathe faster. This is how adrenaline
      gets your body ready to act quickly in urgent situations. Adrenaline is therefore
      also known as the \u2018fight-or-flight hormone\u2019. Adrenaline is the only
      hormone with a fast, short-term effect. "

  - PageTitle: Urinary Tract
    PageInfo: Urine is collected in the renal pelvises, The urine is then sent to
      the bladder via the ureters (see figure 3). Urine is stored temporarily in
      the bladder so that you do not have to urinate all the time. Every now and
      then, urine is disposed of from the bladder through the urethra.
